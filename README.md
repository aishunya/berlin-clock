The Berlin Clock (Mengenlehreuhr) represents time using a series of illuminated colored lights arranged in four rows:

Top Row (Yellow Light): Blinks every second.
Second Row (Red Lights): Each light represents 5 hours (4 lights, maximum of 20 hours).
Third Row (Red Lights): Each light represents 1 hour (4 lights, maximum of 4 hours).
Fourth Row (Yellow and Red Lights): Each light represents 5 minutes (11 lights, where every third light is red to denote quarters of an hour).
Bottom Row (Yellow Lights): Each light represents 1 minute (4 lights, maximum of 4 minutes).
To read the clock, add the values of the illuminated lights in each row to determine the current time.
